    "    Ce programme informatique a une liste de règles préétablies, un peu comme des instructions, pour reconnaître ces noms spéciaux. Les règles préétablies sont généralement créées par des linguistes, des experts en traitement du langage naturel ou des spécialistes du domaine. Ils examinent de nombreux textes pour identifier des modèles et des caractéristiques qui peuvent indiquer la présence d'entités nommées.\n",

    "    Inconvénients et Comparaison : Prenons l'exemple d'un jeu de devinettes. Imagine que tu es en train de jouer à deviner le nom d'une personne, mais les indices que tu reçois sont un peu rigides et basés sur des règles strictes. Par exemple, si quelqu'un dit \"le nom que je pense commence par la lettre B et a six lettres\", tu pourrais essayer des noms comme \"Banane\" ou \"Bateau\" simplement en suivant les règles, même si ce ne sont pas des noms de personnes.\n",

    "    Dans le contexte de la reconnaissance d'entités nommées, la méthode classique avec des règles préétablies est un peu comme cela. Elle peut parfois donner de bons résultats si les règles correspondent bien aux modèles dans le texte, mais elle peut aussi se tromper si le texte ne suit pas exactement les règles prévues. Par exemple, si le texte utilise un surnom pour une personne comme \"Bee\" au lieu de \"Barack\", la méthode classique pourrait ne pas le reconnaître comme un nom de personne.\n",

Le groupe de mots résultant est appelé \"chunk.\" Il n'y a pas de règles pré-définies pour le chunking, mais nous pouvons les créer en fonction de nos besoins.
